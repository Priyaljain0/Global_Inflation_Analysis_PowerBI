ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement: -
Inflation significantly influences economic stability, consumer purchasing power, and investment decisions. However, analyzing global inflation trends is challenging due to inconsistent data formats, limited historical availability, and complex economic interdependencies between countries. This project aims to address these challenges by leveraging Power BI to create an interactive dashboard that visualizes inflation patterns across regions from 2000 to 2024, enabling better understanding and informed decision-making.
ðŸ”¹ Background:
Inflation, a critical economic indicator, impacts consumers, businesses, and policymakers globally. For a multinational corporation operating in diverse markets, inflation affects pricing strategies, investment planning, and risk mitigation. With fluctuating global inflation trends driven by economic shocks like COVID-19 and geopolitical instability, there is a need to analyse and visualize this data comprehensively.
ðŸ”¹ Problem:
There is a lack of integrated, standardized, and historical global inflation data. Without a unified view, organizations struggle to make data-driven decisions regarding pricing, supply chains, and investments. Understanding the interdependencies between regional economies is also difficult due to inconsistent formats and missing historical data.
ðŸ”¹ Key Challenges:
1.	Lack of Data Standardization: Inflation data varies by source and region, affecting aggregation and visualization.
2.	Limited Historical Data Accessibility: Some countries provide incomplete data, limiting long-term trend analysis.
3.	Complex Economic Interdependencies: Inflation in one country often affects others; isolating causes is difficult without advanced modelling.
ðŸ”¹ Goal:
To use Power BI to build an interactive inflation analysis dashboard (2000â€“2024) that uncovers trends, compares countries/regions, and provides stakeholders with actionable insights.
