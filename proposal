Power BI Inflation Analysis: Journeying Through Global Economic Terrain

ðŸŸ¨ Objective:
To develop an interactive Power BI dashboard and accompanying report that analyses global inflation patterns , enabling strategic decision-making for stakeholders.

ðŸŸ© Approach & Solution:
â€¢	Collect inflation data from reliable sources (World Bank, IMF, etc.)
â€¢	Clean, reshape, and standardize data using Power BI Power Query
â€¢	Create calculated columns (YoY Change, Volatility Index, etc.)
â€¢	Design visuals (trend lines, bar charts, maps) for comparisons and storytelling
â€¢	Provide recommendations based on insights

ðŸŸ¥ Technical Architecture (Summary):
â€¢	Data Sources: World Bank, IMF, CSV/Excel (fallback: user-uploaded dataset)
â€¢	Tools Used: Power BI, Excel, Python (optional), GitHub
â€¢	Data Modelling: Star schema (Country-Dimension, Time-Dimension, Inflation-Fact)
â€¢	Visualizations: Line chart (trend), bar chart (top 10), map (regional view), slicers
â€¢	Deployment: Dashboard + report + GitHub repository + optional demo video

ðŸŸ¦ Challenges & Mitigation:
Challenge	Mitigation Approach
Non-standard formats	              Power Query transformations
Missing historical data	              Apply filters and document data gaps
Interdependencies across regions	              Add context with global events/timelines
